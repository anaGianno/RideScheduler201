Designed and implemented a scheduling system for a ride sharing service which uses a 
replaceable binary minimum heap to efficiently manage the ride queue and passenger wait 
times, optimised to combine trips if they are within 10 minutes of each other. Includes Junit test file.


The junit version I used for testing: junit-platform-console-standalone-1.8.1.jar
